Find a Document
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can query for a document in a collection with the ``collection.findOne()``
method.

.. literalinclude:: findOne.go
   :language: go

If you run the example above, you should see a result that looks like this:


.. literalinclude:: findOne.go.result
   :language: none

.. include:: /includes/findOneResult.rst
