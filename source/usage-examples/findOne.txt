Find a Document
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can retrieve a single document from your collection with the
``*Collection.findOne()`` method. 

The ``findOne()`` method takes a takes a query document that specifies the
subset of your collection that you would like to retrieve as an argument. If you
provide an empty document, MongoDB will retrieve your entire collection.

You can specify additional options for your ``findOne()`` method call by passing
the ``findOne()`` method a ``*FindOneOptions`` value. For example, your
``FindOneOptions`` value can specify a skip, sort, and projection for your
``findOne()`` method call. 

The ``findOne()`` method must be passed a ``context.Context`` interface type
value. For more information on the ``context.Context`` interface and the
``context`` package, see our :doc:`guide on context </fundamentals/context>`.

Your ``filter`` argument is your query to MongoDB. The ``filter`` parameter takes a query
document that specifies the subset of your collection that you would like to
retrieve. If you provide an empty document as your ``filter`` argument, MongoDB
returns all the documents in your collection. The ``filter`` parameter has an empty
interface type, but the value you pass as your ``filter`` argument must specify
a document. For more information on documents in the MongoDB Go driver, see our
:doc:`guide on data formats </fundamentals/data-formats>`.

Your configuration object is used to specify any additional configuration
options for your ``findOne()`` method call. A full list of supported options
can be found in 
:go-api:`the API documentation for the FindOneOptions type </mongo/options#FindOneOptions>`. 
In the following example, we specify a **sort** and a **projection** using a
value of type ``*FindOneOptions``.  

Example
-------

The following code example retrieves a single document from the ``movies``
collection. It uses the following functions, methods, and values:

- A **query filter** value that is passed to the ``findOne()`` method. The filter
  matches only movies with the title exactly matching the text ``'The Room'``.

- A **configuration** that **sorts** matched documents in descending order by
  rating, such that the returned document has the highest rating. Our
  configuration also **projects** our results so that only the ``title`` and
  ``imdb`` fields are retrieved.

- An empty **context** returned from the ``context.TODO()`` function.

.. literalinclude:: findOne.go
   :language: go

If you run the example above, you should see a result that looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: findOne.go.txt
   :language: none
