Find a Document
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can query for a document in a collection with the ``collection.findOne()``
method. 

The ``findOne()`` method takes a ``context.Context`` object, a ``filter``, and a
pointer to an ``options.FindOneOptions`` object as arguments.

``context.Context`` is an interface type designed to help a set of go routines
access values tied to a single event. In our application below, we use a
``Context`` set a timeout value of ten seconds for to complete the MongoDB
server requests in the ``main()`` function.

A ''filter'' is an 

.. literalinclude:: findOne.go
   :language: go

If you run the example above, you should see a result that looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: findOne.go.result
   :language: none

section, see the following MongoDB Go Driver API documentation:
