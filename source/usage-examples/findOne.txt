Find a Document
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can retrieve a single document from your collection with the
``*Collection.findOne()`` method. 

..
   method

The ``findOne()`` method takes a takes a query document that specifies the
subset of your collection that you would like to retrieve as an argument. If you
provide an empty document, MongoDB will retrieve your entire collection. For
more information on documents in the MongoDB Go driver, see our
:doc:`guide on data formats </fundamentals/data-formats>`.

The ``findOne()`` method must be passed a ``context.Context`` interface type
value. For more information on the ``context.Context`` interface and the
``context`` package, see our :doc:`guide on context </fundamentals/context>`.

..
   options

You can specify additional options for your ``findOne()`` method call by passing
the ``findOne()`` method a ``*FindOneOptions`` value. For example, your
``FindOneOptions`` value can specify a projection for your results, which
configures the fields in the returned documents. Your can also specify a sort 

..
   return + error

the ``findOne`` returns a value of type ``SingleResult`` that represents one
document. Call the ``*SingleResult.Decode()`` method passing in a pointer to the
variable you would like to unmarshal you document into. If there was an error
retrieving your document, that error will be returned by the ``Decode()``
method. If no documents matched your query, ``Decode()`` will return an
``ErrNoDocuments`` error. 


Example
-------

The following code example retrieves a single document from the ``movies``
collection. It uses the following functions, methods, and values:

- An empty **context** returned from the ``context.TODO()`` function.

- A **query document** that is passed to the ``findOne()`` method. The filter
  only matches movies with the title exactly matching the text ``'The Room'``.

- A **configuration** that specifies a **sort** on matched documents in
  descending order by rating, such that the returned document has the highest
  rating. Our configuration also specifies a **projection** for our results so
  that only the ``title`` and ``imdb`` fields are retrieved.

.. literalinclude:: findOne.go
   :language: go

If you run the example above, you should see a result that looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: findOne.go.txt
   :language: none
