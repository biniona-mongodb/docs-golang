Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to access data with a **cursor**.

A cursor is a mechanism that allows an application to iterate over
database results while holding a subset of them in memory at a given
time. The Go driver uses a cursor in some read operations to return
matched documents in batches as opposed to all at once.

Retrieve Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each section assumes you retrieve all the documents in your collection
with the ``Find()`` function.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin find
   :end-before: end find

Access Cursor Elements
----------------------

You can access a cursors elements before it's exhausted. You exhaust a
cursor when you iterate through its results and reach its last element.
Afterwards, the cursor won't respond to functions to access its elements.

.. important::

   A cursor is not goroutine safe. Do not use the same cursor in
   multiple goroutines at the same time.

Current Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When :ref:`iterating through your cursors results
<cursor-iteration-golang>`, you can view each document as a BSON or Go
type.

BSON
````

To access the current document as raw ``BSON``, use the ``Current``
property.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin current
   :end-before: end current

Go type
```````

To access the current document as a Go type, use the ``Decode()``
function. 

This function unmarshals the current document into the BSON interface
you specify. It returns any errors from the unmarshalling process
without any modification.

.. code-block:: go

   var result bson.D
   if err := cursor.Decode(&result); err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
   }
   fmt.Println(result)

Remaining Batch Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve the amount of doucments remaining in the current batch, use
the ``RemainingBatchLength()`` function.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin remaining batch length
   :end-before: end remaining batch length

.. note::

   If the amount is ``0`` and you call the ``Next()`` or ``TryNext()``
   function, it performs a network request to fetch the next batch.

Cursor ID
~~~~~~~~~

To retrive the ID of the cursor, use the ``ID()`` function. 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin id
   :end-before: end id

.. important::

   Include the option to set your batch size. The batch size needs to be
   a number less than or equal to the number of documents you expect to
   retrieve for a valid cursor ID. If you omit this option, set the
   batch size to greater than the elements retrieved, or exhaust the
   cursor, the cursor ID is ``0``.
   
   .. code-block:: go
      
      opts := options.Find().SetBatchSize(3)
      cursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), bson.D{}, opts)
      if err != nil {
         panic(err)
      }

Errors
~~~~~~

To retrieve the last error the cursor encountered, use the ``Err()``
function. The error is ``nil`` if no errors occured.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin err
   :end-before: end err

.. _cursor-iteration-golang:

Iteration
---------

A cursor allows you to access query results one document at a time,
abstracting away network and caching logic.

.. note::
   
   If you previously used the cursor to iterate some documents, the
   driver excluses those documents when you iterate again. 

All
~~~

To unmarshal all documents stored in the cursor into an array at the
same time, use the ``All()`` function.

This function automatically closes the cursor after retrieving all
documents.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin cursor all
   :end-before: end cursor all

Next
~~~~

To block until a document is available, an error occurs, or the context
expires, use the ``Next()`` function.

The function returns ``true`` if no errors occur and you didn't exhaust
the cursor. Otherwise, the function returns ``false``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin cursor next
   :end-before: end cursor next

Attempt Next
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To attempt retriving the next document in a cursor, use the
``TryNext()`` function. 

The function returns ``false`` if the driver exhausts the cursor, an
error occurs, the next document isn't available or the context expires.
Otherwise, the function returns ``true``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin cursor try next
   :end-before: end cursor try next

Cursor Cleanup
--------------

To free up a cursor's consumption of resources in both the client
application and the MongoDB server, use the ``Close()`` function. 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin close
   :end-before: end close
